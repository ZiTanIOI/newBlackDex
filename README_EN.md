# newBlackDex
Try to revive blackdex. Original project address: https://github.com/CodingGay/BlackDex. It is only upward compatible (the test machine is Android 14). It has not been tested extensively. It is likely to have behaviors including but not limited to failure to unpack, process stuck, abnormal software exit, etc. On the basis of the original unpacking method, active unpacking calls are added (also only for cookie mode). At runtime, try to actively call all classes to deal with class extraction shells. There is no need to try deep unpacking. It has not been repaired. My skills are limited. I really don’t understand the knowledge of dex structure and Android loading dex process. I don’t know much about c. It is not certain whether it will be updated in the future (what if one day I think of it and read some posts and it will be clear at once, hehe) This update is only upward compatible with the version, and there is no over-detection behavior for various reinforcement manufacturers. It depends on luck whether it can be unpacked. What if luck comes? •ᴗ•͈ ♡
